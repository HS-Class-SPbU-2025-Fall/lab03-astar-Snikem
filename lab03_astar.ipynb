    "In this lab, we will consider the problem of finding the shortest path on a graph with a special structure, widely used in robotics and computer games — a grid. The grid consists of both free and blocked cells, and an agent can move from one free cell to another. The connectivity of the grid may vary; for example, a grid might be 4-connected when only cardinal moves (N, E, W, S) are allowed, or 8-connected when diagonal moves are allowed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab, we assume that the grid is 4-connected**, meaning that only moves into the cardinal directions (N, E, W, S) are allowed. The cost of each move between two neighboring cells, represented as $v$ and $v'$, is uniform, with $cost(v, v') = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the seminal `A*` algorithm for finding the shortest path on a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploration will involve two heuristic functions: Manhattan (which is admissible and consistent) and \"noisy Manhattan\" (which is admissible but inconsistent). We'll code two versions of `A*`: one with node re-opening and one without. Notably, the version without node re-opening may not solve the problem accurately when using the inconsistent heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `A*` implementation will draw heavily from the `Dijkstra` algorithm, which we covered in a previous lab.\n",
